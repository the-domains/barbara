# HI, I'M BARBARA

I have been working as a web designer and front end developer since 2007\. The best part of it, for me, is solving problems. I love puzzles and twisted plots.

I love learning new technologies and making the best user interfaces to provide the user a pleasant experience as they get what they need.

If you work with me you'll get an user interface designer, an interaction designer and a front-end developer.

In my free time I listen to podcasts, read, watch movies and TV shows. I live in Porto, Portugal. 

# Work

**Some of my recent projects**

In 2012 I founded a software company with some developers, it's called Bitmaker Software, please [visit our website][0]. We develop software applications, such as [Powerbill][1].

In 2013 I took some time off from Bitmaker and moved to Rome for 6 months to work for the United Nations [World Food Programme][2] where I joined the Logistics Cluster. I designed their [website][3], [branding and identity][4] and was a part of the information management and communications team. I also worked with them developing a new interface for their cargo tracking software, RITA, providing user interface and interaction design, to be launched soon. I still work with them regularly, creating [infographics][5] and a [video][6], among several communication items.

I also created a series of videos for the[Logistics Cluster Cash and Voucher Programmes][7], you can watch them [here][8].

In 2014, I also joined [UNHRD][4], the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot as a web designer, I am currently working on their new website, to launch soon.

This year I joined WFP's Finance team creating several communication items for their global meeting, including brochures, videos and animations, watch it [here][9].
